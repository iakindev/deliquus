**Deliquus aims to find missing test, story files and throw out an error. So you can use with husky and prevent developer from pushing the code before adding a test or story, or you know... anything.**

_Deliquus is a latin adjective meaning missing, wanting, lacking._

## Usage

- Install with `yarn add --dev deliquus` or `npm install deliquus --save-dev`
- Create a valid cosmiconfig file (See: [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig#cosmiconfig)) that exports an object containing:
  ```javascript
  {
    sources: [{ pattern: 'GLOB_PATTERN', for: 'TARGET_NAME', name: 'SOURCE_NAME' }],
    targets: [{ pattern: 'GLOB_PATTERN', name: 'NAME' }],
  }
  ```
  - Check `deliquusrc.js` file to see a working example.
  - You can set multiple sources with multiple targets.
  - You should reference target that you want to match the source with in for array in source object.
  - You can set multiple targets in for. For example you can check if stories and tests existing for `components` source without redefining the same directory.
- Execute with `yarn deliquus` or `npm run deliquus` or bind to husky (recommended).

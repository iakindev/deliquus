# Deliquus

**Deliquus is a latin adjective meaning missing, wanting, lacking.**

**Deliquus aims to find missing test, story files and throw out an error. So you can use with husky and prevent developer from pushing the code before adding a test or story, or you know... anything.**

## Goal

We want deliquus to be configurable/customizable on every level possible.  
We don't want it to be a tool that only finds tests and stories.  
User should be configure Deliquus to match the files as she/he want.

## Roadmap

- Match files with single source directory and single target directory.
- Match files with multiple source directory and multiple target directory.
- Publish

  $ yarn dev
  ```

- Build

  ```bash

  ```
